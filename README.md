# Introduction 
.net6 C# Sample App - A modern distributed DDD service api template

# Getting Started
1.	Clone and run - swagger page opens, using the same port and root folder shows a basic js UI
2.	Run tests

# Notes
1. This sample uses Entity Framework Core in-memory DbContext, so restarting the app clears the DB
2. This solution provides a possible starting template for building service apis and is not production-ready (in-memory database, no authentication, etc)
